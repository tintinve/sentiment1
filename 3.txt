00:00:01:00 - 00:00:01:15
Speaker 1
Just good.

00:00:01:16 - 00:00:13:25
Speaker 2
Yes. So you. So there are no good or bad questions is just information of how you understand some aspects that I will use in my research so.

00:00:14:20 - 00:00:16:13
Speaker 2
That I can start writing.

00:00:16:27 - 00:00:18:22
Speaker 1
You.

00:00:19:20 - 00:00:22:13
Speaker 2
So please, can you say your name? Yes. So it stays there.

00:00:22:16 - 00:00:24:09
Speaker 1
So my name is Andrea. Freedom.

00:00:24:16 - 00:00:28:08
Speaker 2
Super Andrea. What is a brief?

00:00:29:08 - 00:00:59:28
Speaker 1
I guess you're asking in the context of service design. So. But let's go broad a brief, which really is a short, I would say question or statement could be a statement as well that is very specific to that is pointing out A.P. ICT direction and that could be used like to conduct a project but as well you can have a brief with your team in the morning.

00:00:59:28 - 00:01:04:06
Speaker 1
I give you a brief and we think about that throughout the day, for example.

00:01:04:11 - 00:01:17:10
Speaker 2
So thank you very much. Yeah. And then not only in essence D, but which, in which context you have use a brief. Hmm.

00:01:20:09 - 00:01:50:03
Speaker 1
Well, I think it's, it's very using necessity. Besides that, I would say, for example, I would imagine in a teamwork or in a company in the morning, we take 10 minutes all together and we brief about something that will happen to the day or that we have to do later. So I would use a brief in that context as well.

00:01:50:05 - 00:01:51:18
Speaker 1
I would say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:51:23 - 00:01:55:13
Speaker 2
Right. And what is the most important aspect of a brief.

00:01:55:24 - 00:01:56:05
Speaker 2
When you.

00:01:56:05 - 00:01:59:04
Speaker 1
Like? I think it has to be very clear.

00:01:59:06 - 00:01:59:17
Speaker 2
Okay.

00:02:00:00 - 00:02:18:03
Speaker 1
This for me is the most important aspect. It has to be very clear and understandable, like for yourself, if you see it today or if you see it in two weeks later. But also if you are in a team, everybody has to look at it and clearly like, aha, this is direction. Yes, this is what we are looking for.

00:02:18:04 - 00:02:20:12
Speaker 1
So it has to be clear, graphic.

00:02:20:20 - 00:02:30:22
Speaker 2
Perfect. You know, providing programming. Mm hmm. What do you think is the most important aspect of programming?

00:02:31:05 - 00:03:07:24
Speaker 1
Most of the things about it can make some discourse very. And it it can improve the time that you use to do some discourse. So, for example, there are things that you can do in Excel or by hand, but if you apply some programme skills, they will be much quicker. And I also see that you can process a big amount of data that you wouldn't be able or you wouldn't be able to do it so easily manually, and you can do it like weekly with having with a programme.

00:03:08:11 - 00:03:10:24
Speaker 2
But what is hard about programming?

00:03:11:07 - 00:03:12:06
Speaker 1
It's the programming.

00:03:12:06 - 00:03:14:17
Speaker 2
It's probably so.

00:03:16:07 - 00:03:43:03
Speaker 1
Yes. So if I, for example, for me, I can it's easier to understand that is very useful and it's very important. And and I also think would be very nice that would be teach that school since the beginning. But all the logic behind it's the hardest parts. So I can say that, okay, this is the steps I want the programme to give me a number bigger than ten and forget.

00:03:43:03 - 00:03:49:29
Speaker 1
I need a few aspects, but to do it to code is the language actually.

00:03:50:09 - 00:03:51:07
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

00:03:51:08 - 00:03:55:02
Speaker 1
So that would be perfect. Yes.

00:03:55:03 - 00:03:56:12
Speaker 2
And what is easy about it?

00:03:58:11 - 00:04:20:17
Speaker 1
Well, I think the easiest part is that when we want to do you know what you can do. So of course. And they are space to do like a bigger code or a small one, but it has a certain kind of, um, it's sharp and of all said, um, it's straightforward.

00:04:20:22 - 00:04:21:19
Speaker 2
Okay. Okay.

00:04:21:26 - 00:04:36:10
Speaker 1
So if you write an essay, you never know if the teacher will understand it in a clear way or not in the in a programme you can discuss. Okay. Is this useful or not? But if it's working, it's working.

00:04:36:22 - 00:04:38:09
Speaker 2
Okay. Okay.

00:04:39:02 - 00:04:57:20
Speaker 1
And that's a very good aspect that I am also feeling now. I have like these questions about other other courses, like I have to open essay, but why is the teacher expecting from me in the programming class? I know what he's expecting from me. Do you have libraries to call an API? So that's.

00:04:57:20 - 00:04:58:16
Speaker 2
Clear. Okay.

00:04:59:00 - 00:05:03:13
Speaker 1
Another thing is, am I able to do it or not?

00:05:03:13 - 00:05:13:16
Speaker 2
Okay, perfect. And how would you design a website in in a brief way, what would be the first step? The second step? How would you do it?

00:05:15:09 - 00:05:15:28
Speaker 2
My God.

00:05:16:09 - 00:05:18:22
Speaker 1
In a brief way, I know programming in.

00:05:18:26 - 00:05:19:28
Speaker 2
Your way, you know.

00:05:20:28 - 00:05:44:25
Speaker 1
So I will think which kind of information I would like to present on the website, but it would be my user. Yeah, because according with my user, I will adapt my language. Yeah, I like the content and the way that I will explain. I also will do like a quick, you know, quick, quick drawing of the website. How many pages do I want?

00:05:44:29 - 00:05:59:21
Speaker 1
How do I want to divide the information? So it is just a line page or I want like a normal page and then another page for services. So before I will start to do the website, I will think on these three things.

00:05:59:21 - 00:06:04:25
Speaker 2
And it's a perfect. So would you consider yourself protein or a non.

00:06:04:25 - 00:06:07:09
Speaker 1
Programming a non programmer, unfortunately.

00:06:07:26 - 00:06:11:01
Speaker 2
And how would you describe then yourself professionally?

00:06:12:11 - 00:06:19:14
Speaker 1
Uh, well, I'm a future service designer. I hope so. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:19:14 - 00:06:21:02
Speaker 2
Do we know what is front and, and.

00:06:22:03 - 00:07:03:10
Speaker 1
Um. Okay, so I know, like, I might be saying, a very silly foods. So from then if you're in programme from then in backend and I would say like people working in frontend might be clearly like working with the website to expect for example where to place some of the tags and the buttons and like the page in backend more like what is needed behind the scene when a user like is introducing, I'm going to I don't know where the website called in Copenhagen.

00:07:03:14 - 00:07:11:18
Speaker 1
Yeah. Right in Copenhagen. In to get the weather of Copenhagen. So back in these like everything that is even in the user can not see.

00:07:12:12 - 00:07:14:07
Speaker 2
Okay. Okay. I think. Yeah.

00:07:14:18 - 00:07:18:07
Speaker 1
And I think they are need. Yeah. You have to programme that part as well.

00:07:18:10 - 00:07:18:24
Speaker 2
Yes.

00:07:18:29 - 00:07:20:19
Speaker 1
So I would say.

00:07:21:01 - 00:07:23:04
Speaker 2
So that's front end.

00:07:23:07 - 00:07:25:04
Speaker 1
That's back and that's that's back.

00:07:25:05 - 00:07:25:26
Speaker 2
End and front.

00:07:26:05 - 00:07:33:13
Speaker 1
From then will be like in in programming terms you are a programme remember you are designing the website like self.

00:07:33:22 - 00:07:34:04
Speaker 2
Okay.

00:07:34:07 - 00:07:42:01
Speaker 1
Okay. So you there is a window here, you can close here, you can open the website. This will be more front and yes in contact with the user.

00:07:42:14 - 00:07:46:27
Speaker 2
Okay. Alright. And do you know any tools to do frontend. No, no, no.

00:07:47:12 - 00:07:57:07
Speaker 1
I think you can use Figma to the front end and then. Well because I'm not that I'm you also can programme in Java I think or C.

00:07:57:13 - 00:07:58:03
Speaker 2
Frontend.

00:07:58:03 - 00:08:09:02
Speaker 1
Fighting and fun then. Okay. And then there is this like user friendly pages, kind of like a WordPress and we something.

00:08:09:05 - 00:08:09:18
Speaker 2
Yes.

00:08:09:28 - 00:08:10:26
Speaker 1
But you can use.

00:08:11:21 - 00:08:11:28
Speaker 2
And.

00:08:12:03 - 00:08:16:17
Speaker 1
I'm not sure if I'm correct but it's just just I guess.

00:08:18:06 - 00:08:20:23
Speaker 2
It's perfectly fine. Yeah. And backend but.

00:08:21:07 - 00:08:22:17
Speaker 1
So for example. Yeah.

00:08:23:11 - 00:08:25:23
Speaker 1
You can, I think you can use Python for that.

00:08:26:21 - 00:08:28:13
Speaker 2
All right. Yeah. Alright.

00:08:28:13 - 00:08:29:21
Speaker 1
And for sure there is.

00:08:31:02 - 00:08:34:02
Speaker 2
And you know the difference between a website and kind.

00:08:34:02 - 00:08:35:10
Speaker 2
Of target audience is.

00:08:36:00 - 00:08:58:17
Speaker 1
Like well help, you have to use it on your phone. You asking me questions, have you have to use on your phone. I think you programme it in a different way. Maybe as well. It might be that you programme in a different way, but you use and you can also download it. Yeah. You cannot download the website.

00:08:58:20 - 00:08:58:28
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:08:59:12 - 00:09:19:06
Speaker 1
So I hope you can download for a web phone or also for it for a cell phone or I guess for an iPad as well. Okay. Um, but a website. No, you have to access online could be through the web font or the phone or on the computer. But you, you don't have it installed on your devices.

00:09:19:07 - 00:09:24:18
Speaker 2
Perfect. Perfect. So what is Python mainly used for?

00:09:25:03 - 00:09:48:05
Speaker 1
About as far as I know, natural language processing, I would say, is the language that is more mainly used when that feels. Yeah. Um, I guess other programme like could be used in other things, but I wouldn't say like that. I would use Python took to do a website.

00:09:48:05 - 00:09:51:03
Speaker 2
Perfect. And each HTML you know what is it.

00:09:51:14 - 00:09:55:13
Speaker 1
And that is a language and I guess it's more associated with frontend.

00:09:55:23 - 00:09:57:08
Speaker 2
Perfect and thesis.

00:09:58:13 - 00:10:02:18
Speaker 1
I guess for frontend as well. And I think Java as well.

00:10:02:23 - 00:10:02:29
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:10:03:11 - 00:10:12:00
Speaker 1
But maybe those last three you can use also the backend. But I would say for me Python is more like natural language processing. Yeah.

00:10:12:15 - 00:10:12:23
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:10:13:14 - 00:10:26:03
Speaker 1
Yeah. Or some statistic or I connect it more with other things like ah, even though I is not, I don't think I use like uh like raw programming language, but.

00:10:26:25 - 00:10:30:04
Speaker 2
Other words I think I'm not sure but I think ah is part of Python.

00:10:30:07 - 00:10:30:27
Speaker 1
Part of Python.

00:10:30:27 - 00:10:32:09
Speaker 2
Okay, it's a library but I'm.

00:10:32:09 - 00:10:35:04
Speaker 1
Not sure I would connect those like but.

00:10:35:12 - 00:10:35:29
Speaker 2
Is more.

00:10:36:01 - 00:10:39:17
Speaker 1
For statistical analysis. Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:39:18 - 00:10:41:28
Speaker 2
And I think it's for artificial intelligence. Yeah.

00:10:42:07 - 00:10:47:04
Speaker 1
But yeah. Exactly like eye tracking and yeah, yeah.

00:10:47:13 - 00:10:48:02
Speaker 2
That would be okay.

00:10:48:14 - 00:10:50:06
Speaker 1
Oh, okay. Perfect. Thank you.

00:10:50:06 - 00:10:54:22
Speaker 2
Thank you. But I think your your answers will be super, super helpful for them.

00:10:54:27 - 00:10:55:18
Speaker 1
I hope so.
